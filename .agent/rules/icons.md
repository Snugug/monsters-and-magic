All images are SVGs stored in `src/components/Sprite.astro` as an SVG Icon Sprite. **CORE REQUIREMENT** Any new icons you create **MUST** be SVGs, **MUST** be placed in the Icon Sprite, **MUST** have an ID that starts with `icon--`, **MUST** be monochromatic, and **MUST** match the sizing and style of 24px Google Material Design icons. To do so, use the Material Design Icons GitHub source code (https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/src) to see existing icons, and Google's best practices for designing icons (https://m3.material.io/styles/icons/designing-icons) for creating new ones.

To use an icon from the Icon Sprite, use the components from `Icon.svelte` and pass in the icon name. The icon name is the part of the ID that follows `icon--` in the ID, so an icon with ID `icon--hourglass` has a name of `hourglass`.
