BEFORE adding a dependency, check to see if the functionality you want to add, or a suitable alternative is already present in the codebase.

You MUST NOT add _any_ dependencies to the project without FIRST getting pre-approval in an implementation plan. ANY REQUESTS TO ADD DEPENDENCIES THROUGH A COMMAND WITHOUT AN APPROVED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WILL BE REJECTED.
