Examine a foe for weak points; make a focus roll against a creature you can see. On a weak hit, hold 1-vulnerability, on a strong hit, hold 2-vulnerability. When you damage that creature with a strong hit, you can spend 1-vulnerability to apply weakened, sundered, or slowed. Your hold lasts until the the creature is dead or until the end of combat.
