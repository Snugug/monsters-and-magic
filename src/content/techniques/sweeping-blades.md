You start to whirl two weapons you're wielding into a tornado of blades around you, blocking incoming blows at the same time you unleash a flurry of them in return. Mark 2-fatigue to become hold 3-flurry and become protected until no longer have any flurry remaining. When attacked by a creature within your reach, spend 1-flurry to have them mark 1-fatigue as part of their attack. Your hold lasts until the end of combat.
