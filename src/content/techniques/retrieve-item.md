Mark 1-fatigue to retrieve an item that's either within close range or that's on your person and not part of your current load out. As part of this, you can add a number of small items (like potions or daggers) to your current load out equal to your +CUNNING, provided you have free spots for them. Alternatively, you can use this to swap your current weapon load out.
