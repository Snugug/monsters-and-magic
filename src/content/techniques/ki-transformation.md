Clear all held ki to transform into a ki powered warrior. While transformed, gain +1 ongoing to attack and damage rolls for every 3 ki you cleared. This transformation lasts for one minute. While transformed, your ki swirls around you in a harmless aura, radiating bright light for 10 feet and dim light for another 20 feet.
