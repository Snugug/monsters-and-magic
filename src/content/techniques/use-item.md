Use an item from your current load out, such as a potion. As part of this action, you can hand the item to another creature within melee range of you, or administer it to an unconscious creature within melee range. If an item has an AP cost to use (like a spell scroll), the AP spent on this technique counts as part of the total AP cost to use.
