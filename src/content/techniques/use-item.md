Use an item from your current loadout, such as a potion. As part of this action, you can hand the item to another creature within touch range of you, or administer it to an unconscious creature within touch range. If an item has an AP cost to use (like a spell scroll), the AP spent on this technique counts as part of the total AP cost to use.
