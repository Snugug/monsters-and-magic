Focus your ki to prepare yourself for your fight. Hold 1-ki. Whenever you use this technique again, add to your existing held ki. Spend ki 1:1 to reduce fatigue spent on using a technique. You can use this multiple times per turn, each time you do so, its AP cost is increased by 1. Cannot be used outside of combat, and any held ki is lost when combat ends.
