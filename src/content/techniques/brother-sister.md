Mark 2-fatigue and make a ranged attack against a creature with one of the two weapons you are wielding, then move up to your speed to that creature and attack it with advantage with your other weapon. Your movement doesn't provoke reactions from moving out of range of a creature. If you threw a weapon, you can retrieve it when you reach the target creature as part of this technique.
