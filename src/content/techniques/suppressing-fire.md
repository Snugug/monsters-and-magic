Mark up to 3-fatigue and hold 1-supression for each fatigue marked to lay down a barrage of attacks with a ranged weapon. While you have your hold, as a reaction, you can spend 1-supression to force any creature you can see that directly targets an ally within your ranged weapon's reach to mark 2-fatigue as part of their attack. You cannot use this reaction if you're within an enemy's reach. Your hold lasts until the end of combat.
