Make a cunning roll while behind total cover or otherwise out of line of sight; on a weak hit, you become invisible, on a strong hit you also gain advantage on the first attack roll you make against a creature you are invisible from. If you move into line of sight of a creature, you attack, or otherwise make your location known, the invisible status ends on you.
