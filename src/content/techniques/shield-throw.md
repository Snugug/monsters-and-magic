Mark up to 3-fatigue to throw your shield, hitting a number of creatures equal to the amount of fatigue you marked. Each creature must be within short range of the previous one. Make a power roll against each creature; on a weak hit, they mark 1-fatigue, on a strong hit they mark 2-fatigue. The shield then returns to your hand.
