You’ve fallen to the ground—you become slowed, can only crawl to move, have disadvantage on attack rolls, and attack rolls against you have advantage if the attacker is within touch range of you and disadvantage if they’re further away. You can end this condition by taking the Move technique to stand up, spending ½ your maximum Speed.
