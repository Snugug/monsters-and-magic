You can consult an accurate nonfiction book about a topic. If you know it's relevant and read it, you become prepared to act on the knowledge you gained. If you don't know if it's relevant, make a luck rollâ€”on a strong hit, you become prepared as normal, on a weak hit, you instead learn something interesting, and it's up to you to make it relevant.

Once you've read a book, you can't learn anything new from it again.
