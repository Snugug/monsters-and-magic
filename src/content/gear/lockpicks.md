A set of small files, a small handle-mounted mirror, narrow scissors, a small set of pliers, and lockpicks.

When trying to pick a non-magical lock with a lockpicking kit, make a luck roll. On a miss, a lockpick breaks, loose one use. On a weak hit, gain +1 ongoing to attempts to pick this lock, but a lockpick breaks as well, loose one use. On a strong hit, you successfully pick the lock.
