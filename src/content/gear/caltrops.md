Spread across a 10' areaâ€”creatures that move through it make a luck roll; on a miss they take 1 damage, bypassing their AC, and become immobile for 10 minutes or until they spend a turn removing the caltrops from their feet. Once affected, subsequent rolls against the same area of caltrops are made with advantage.
