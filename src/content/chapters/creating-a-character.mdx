title: Creating a Character
chapter: 2

When you create a character, you choose their lineage, heritage, talents, abilities, bonds, starting equipment, and bonds.

## Character Origins

In Monsters & Magic, you're a character in a story, and all great characters start with a compelling backstory. To start building your character, you first need to determine their origin. To do so, choose your lineage—your bloodline and the bloodline of your parents. You have 3 lineage points you can spend on choosing traits from your lineage. Your parents may have had different lineages, if so choose a second lineage and purchase traits from both lineages—you must have at least one trait from each lineage, and you cannot spend more tha 3 lineage points total. Your size and appearance is based on your lineage(s), and your speed is 30'.

Next, choose your heritage. Each heritage describes your background or how you've lived your life, and will give you some bonus or additional thing you can do because of it.

Finally, describe your background before you started adventuring and write two talents representing the skills and experiences you gained before you ventured forth. Talents should not be combat related or imply a specific gameplay bonus, like "one-hit kill assassin", or "never-miss marksman", instead they should build on your heritage and the story you're trying to tell with your character—a Noble may have a talent "Princess of the House of Dragons" whereas a Criminal may have a talent "Magic Item Fence for the Big City Thieves' Guild". As you level up, you'll have the ability to gain additional talents and improve upon the talents you select here.

## Classes & Proficiencies

Once you've created your character's origins, it's time to decide how they're adventuring out into the world! Choose a class for your character—your class determines your character's HP (plus any bonuses you get from your lineage, and 5 HP per +POWER) and may provide additional proficiencies, techniques, and talents for you to select (remember, all characters are proficient with simple weapons). Classes each also have **core feats**—you gain both of them.

As you level up, you'll gain the ability to learn additional feats—you can either take an additional feat from your class or from another class. If you choose to take one from another class, you must first take one of those classes' **core feats** before taking additional feats from that class. This is called multiclassing. You can multiclass as much as you'd like, but remember that, not including the core feats you start with, you can only take a total of 5 feats, so choose wisely! There are generally no restrictions on taking additional feats other than you can only have one **spellcasting** feat, which will be marked as such, and if a more advanced feat has references features of another feat that you don't have, you can only use the portions of the feat that you meet the prerequisites for.

You'll start the game by choosing one technique, and you'll gain the ability to learn new techniques or charms (if you're a spellcaster), ain weapon proficiency and mastery, and increase your HP as you level up.

Finally, mark your proficiency bonus as +1. Whenever you reach a new tier of play, your proficiency bonus increases by 1.

## Abilities

Once you have your character's origin, class, and proficiencies squared away, it's time to pick your abilities.

Abilities can range from -2 to 5, and you start with two abilities at 0 and two abilities at 1. You can then decrease any ability by 1 to increase any other ability by 1. At character creation, no ability can be higher than 2. Once you reach **Heroic Tier**, abilities can have a maximum of 3, at **Epic Tier** a maximum of 4, and at **Legendary Tier** a maximum of 5.

## Session 0

Before you start playing, you should have an introductory session, often called a Session 0, to get an introduction to the world, have game expectations set, and to build your characters' collective backstory with each other. While the GM may include additional activities to do during your Session 0, you should make sure that you include an activity to weave your characters' pre-adventuring lives to explain how you all have come together.

Once your characters are built, pass your character sheet to the player to your left and have them write a time where their character had the spotlight in your character's story—this should respect your character concept. Then, pass to the left again, and again, until everyone's character sheet returns to their owners. Everyone's characters should now have a personal backstory where they've interacted with each other character in the group.

Once you have your character sheet back, write bonds for each of the characters in your group based on the backstory that has been built with this activity.

## Tiers of Play & Leveling Up

When you reach the end of a session, choose one bond you feel is completely explored, no longer relevant, or otherwise resolved. If both you and the character’s player agree, mark it as complete, and write a new bond with whomever you wish. Then, answer the following questions, plus your class question:

- Did I resolve a bond?
- Did I learn something new and important about the world?
- Did I overcome a notable monster or enemy?
- Did I loot a memorable treasure?

For each “yes” answer, mark 1 XP.

There are four tiers of gameplay, **Journeyman**, **Heroic**, **Epic**, and **Legendary**, each representing a different step in your journey towards writing your character's legend. When you have enough XP to reach your next level, you can take the **Level Up** extended rest downtime activity to reflect on your experiences and hone your skills to level up. When you do, mark two options either from your current gameplay tier's list or an earlier list. Whenever you enter a new tier of gameplay, you gain a talent and +1 to your proficiency bonus.
