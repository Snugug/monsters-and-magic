## Challenge Rating & Points

A monster's relative difficulty is based on their Challenge Rating, or CR, which is in turn based on the number of points it took to build that particular monster. Every choice you make when building a monster, from its abilities to its attributes to its traits, even to its size, cost a certain number of points. Some choices are more powerful than others, being gargantuan, for instance, comes with a lot of bonuses and as such cost more than being tiny, which comes with some drawbacks so actually removes some points.

Once you've added up all the points for a monster, subtract seven (challenge rating rounds up at 7, not 5, which is why we're subtracting 7 here), divide by ten, and round up—that's the monster's challenge rating. So, for instance, if you had a monster that had 27 total points, it's CR would be 2, but if you had a monster whose total points were 18, that would also be a CR 2 (18 - 7 is 11, divided by 10 is 1.1, rounded up is 2).

The point based system makes scaling monsters fairly straight forward. Want a scarier swarm of rats for your new adventuring party? Take an existing monster and increase its damage or AC just enough to bump it up! Want to make a creature resistant to fire damage? See how that'll affect the overall challenge rating!

Challenge Rating affects what monsters you put your players up against. A general rule of thumb is one CR1 monster per player for a challenging but not deadly encounter at Heroic Tier. For a party of 4, this could be 4 CR1 monsters, two CR2 monsters, one CR4 monster or, if you want a real battle, 8 CR0 monsters. At Epic and Legendary tiers, add an additional CR1 monster into your calculations, representing the expanding skill set of your players.

## Size

Monsters come in many sizes, ranging from tiny all the way up to gargantuan. Each size has a base damage output, a base set of HP, a base speed, a base reach, what size area it fits into, and how many points it adds to the monster.

|    Size    | Damage | HP  | Speed |  Space  | Reach | Points |
| :--------: | :----: | :-: | :---: | :-----: | :---: | :----: |
|    Tiny    |  1d4   |  3  |  20'  | 2½'×2½' |  5'   |   -1   |
|   Small    |  1d6   |  4  |  30'  |  5'×5'  |  5'   |   0    |
|   Medium   |  1d6   |  5  |  30'  |  5'×5'  |  5'   |   0    |
|   Large    |  1d8   |  6  |  40'  | 10'×10' |  5'   |   1    |
|    Huge    |  1d10  |  7  |  40'  | 15'×15' |  10'  |   2    |
| Gargantuan |  1d12  | 10  |  40'  | 20'×20' |  15'  |   3    |

You can also choose to make a _swarm_ of monsters. When making a swarm of monsters, first you choose how large the swarm is, then you choose the size of the creatures in the swarm, which must be at least one size category smaller. The size of the swarm determines its space, the size of the creatures determines the rest. Swarms differ from normal creatures in that they cannot gain temporary HP, cannot regain HP, and deal ½ damage when bloodied. Making a creature a swarm subtracts 2 points from the monster's point total.

## Abilities

Abilities work the same way they do for player characters, except they can go from -5 to +5, except for Luck, which can only go to -2. Monsters, like PCs, start with two abilities at +1.

Points for abilities are calculated by adding up the total values for Focus, Power, Cunning, and Luck, subtracting 2, then multiplying by 2. For a monster with 0/1/1/0 its 0 points, 0/0/0/0 its -4 points, -1/3/1/0 its 2 points.

## Traits

Traits make monsters stand out. There are a number of traits available

Swarms cannot regain HP or gain temporary HP and deal ½ damage when bloodied.

Create a table of all of the traits that all monsters have. If traits have different names, like "Agile" or "Flyby", but have very similar or identical wording, combine them into a single trait. If a monster has multiattack as an action, include that as a trait. Return a table of all of the traits, their descriptions, and a list of monsters that include that trait.
Using the same prompt as before, rebuild the table, but this time if a trait can be described by a combination of other traits (like fire form, air form, and compression), combine those portions into a single trait instead of having different traits, with a new unique name, if needed, to describe the relevant portions
