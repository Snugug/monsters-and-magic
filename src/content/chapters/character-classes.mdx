Choose a class. Each class has a number of feats you can choose. When you choose a class, you gain their two core feats, as well as their HP and any proficiencies or techniques they provide.

import Icon from '$components/Icon.svelte';

        </span>
      </td>
      <td>Core Feat</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 5ch;">
        <span style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
          <Icon label="Spellcasting Feat" icon="wand" />
        </span>
      </td>
      <td>Spellcasting Feat</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 5ch;">
        <span style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
          <Icon label="Rare Feat" icon="flare" />

    </tr>

When you level up, you can either take a feat from your class or from another class, as long as you have you have at least one core feat from that classâ€”if you don't, you need to take a core feat from that class first. You can only have a spellcasting feat from one class, and you can only take rare feats starting at Epic tier.
