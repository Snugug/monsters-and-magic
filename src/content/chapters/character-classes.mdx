Choose a class. Each class has a number of feats you can choose. When you choose a class, you gain their two core feats, as well as their HP and any proficiencies or techniques they provide.

When you level up, you can either take a feat from your class or from another class, as long as you have you have at least one core feat from that class—if you don't, you need to take a core feat from that class first. You can only have a spellcasting feat from one class, and you can only take rare feats starting at Epic tier.
