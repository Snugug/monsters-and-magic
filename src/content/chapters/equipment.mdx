## Weight and carrying capacity

While adventuring, you're going to pick up stuff, and that stuff has weight. How much weight you can lug around is your carrying capacity, and how much you're currently carrying is your load.

Each 1 weight weighs approximately 5-10 lbs. There are some items, though, that have a negligible effect on your load; they have 0 weight. Other items only have an effect on your load when you've got a bunch of them, those are marked as light weight. 10 light weight items, in any combination, weighs 1 weight. Some items, like a backpack, make it easier to carry more; their weight is negative. Any combination of 1000 gold and gems that don't have their own weight has 1 weight.

Your carrying capacity is the most you can carry before becoming encumbered and is equal to double your +POWER plus 10. When you're encumbered, you have -1 movement and take -1 ongoing to all rolls until you're no longer encumbered. Your load can never be more than your carrying capacity +3.

## Weapons

Weapons deal damage! If you have mastery with a weapon, you gain its technique for free, as long as you continue to have mastery of it. Some weapons also have properties describing how they can, or need to, be used.

Unarmed and improvised attacks deal 1 damage.

:::message[Weapons in Story Mode]

If playing in story mode, you deal half the weapon's damage die instead of rolling for damage, so a dagger that deals 1d4 damage would deal 2 damage. If a weapon deals more than 1 die of damage, you deal damage for each die, plus 1 for each die above 1. For a maul that deals 2d6 damage, for instance, you'd deal 3 + 3 + 1 damage for a total of 7 damage.

:::

Some weapons have special weapon properties—every property always applies to the weapon when wielded. All weapons also have a mastery property—if you gain weapon mastery of that weapon, you can use the mastery property.

### Weapon Properties

Agile
: Can use +CUNNING instead of +POWER for attack and damage rolls. If wielding two agile weapons and deal damage or fatigue to a creature with your primary weapon, you can spend 1-fatigue to attack it with your secondary weapon; this damage does not include your ability score.

Heavy
: Requires +POWER of 1 or greater to wield.

Piercing
: Ignore an amount of AC equal to the piercing amount when dealing weapon damage, or deal additional fatigue equal to ½ the piercing amount (minimum 1) when dealing fatigue.

Precise
: Rewards careful strikes over brute force, can use +FOCUS instead of +POWER for attack and damage rolls.

Reach
: Melee weapons only. Your reach with this weapon is 10' instead of the normal 5'.

Reload
: Takes extra effort to reload-it can only be fired once per turn

Simple
: Basic weapons anyone can use.

Thrown
: Can be thrown. If thrown, it's treated as a ranged weapon (but cannot use ammunition) and has a range of 30'.

Two-handed
: Unwieldy and must be used with two hands

Versatile
: Can wield with one hand or two; if wielding with two, add +1 damage to damage rolls when used as a melee weapon. Can swap between one handed and two handed by using Use Item

### Weapon Mastery

Nick
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 1-fatigue on a strong hit to apply sundered

Graze
: When you strike with this weapon and miss, deal damage equal to your +POWER.

Ring
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 2-fatigue on a hit to apply impaired

Cleave
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 1-fatigue to deal half the damage you dealt to your target to another creature within the weapon's reach.

Sap
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 1-fatigue on a hit to apply weakened

Pinpoint
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 1-fatigue on a hit to become prepared for your next attack roll against your target.

## Foci

Foci allow you to channel your magic, letting you cast spells as a spellcaster. In order to cast spells, you must have at least one focus equipped. Each focus has a set of properties that affect your spellcasting when equipped. In addition to the foci below, any simple melee weapon can be used as a focus and have the **assail** property—a few common weapon foci are presented below. Some foci have weapon properties like **two-handed** and **versatile**—refer to those properties for definitions.

:::message[Dual-Wielding Foci]{.info}

Because you don't need an empty hand to cast spells as long as you're wielding a focus, think about how you may dual-wield with them! You could wield a dagger and orb to get the benefits of either one depending on which you use to cast your spells. Or a wand and a shield for extra protection.

:::

import Foci from '$components/mdx/Foci.svelte';

<Foci />

### Foci Properties

Assail
: Can be used as the normal weapon, or can Use Item and channel one of your cantrips. While channeled, the weapon takes on a magical appearance in line with the cantrip being used, you can cast spells with that cantrip at melee range, and you can substitute a base level cantrip for a weapon attack taking reactions. You can Use Item again to change your weapon back to its normal form or to another cantrip.

Extend
: When you apply a condition or status with a spell through this focus, you can mark 1-fatigue per target to extend its duration by 1 round. You can choose how many targets to extend.

Empower
: When you strike a creature with a cantrip through this focus, add your +SPELL to the damage you deal (half if you deal fatigue).

## Armor

Armor is your level of protection against incoming blows, and comes in three types: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Light armor provides the least amount of protection, but it's the easiest to wear—you add your full +CUNNING to your AC when wearing it. Medium armor provides a moderate amount of protection but is bulkier—you add half of your +CUNNING to your AC when wearing it. Heavy armor provides the most protection, but it's bulky—you don't add your +CUNNING to your AC when wearing it.

Some armor is bulky enough that you need a minimum amount of +POWER to wear it. If your +POWER is less than the required amount, you can't wear that armor. If it's equal to your +POWER, you take -2 ongoing to all rolls to attempt to be stealthy or sneaky while wearing it.

You can also equip a shield. Shields provide a bonus to your AC while wielding it. Unlike armor, shields are part of your loadout.

import Armor from '$components/mdx/Armor.svelte';

## Gear & Packs

Weapons and armor aren't the only things you need to survive on your adventure, you need gear too! Gear can be broken down into four categories: adventuring gear, musical instruments, and tools.

Adventuring Gear
: Gear and equipment an adventurer may need throughout their travels.

Musical instruments
: A tool to play music. If you have a talent that would give you proficiency with a musical instrument, you can typically earn extra gold when you perform with one when you use the Get a Job downtime activity. Under some circumstances, a GM may let you use a musical instrument as a focus.

Tools
: Let you Work on a Project that requires special tools when you're not in a settlement that has a permanent workshop dedicated to the required craft.

Packs are specially priced collections of predefined adventuring gear (presented weights are approximates). When you start your adventure, you get 50 gold to spend on gear and packs.

## Potions and Spell Scrolls

Potions and spell scrolls are both containers for magic, allowing even those without magical inclination to dabble in the arcane arts. When using a potion or spell scroll, if the spell being cast calls for your spellcasting modifier (+SPELL) and the spell either isn't from your spellcasting source or you can't cast spells, treat +SPELL as 0.

Potions and spell scrolls both cost the same amount, and are based on how much fatigue is required to cast them:

| Fatigue | Cost  | Rarity    | Count |
| :-----: | :---: | :-------- | :---: |
|    0    | 200g  | Common    |   8   |
|    1    | 300g  | Common    |   9   |
|    2    | 500g  | Uncommon  |  10   |
|    3    | 800g  | Uncommon  |  11   |
|    4    | 1200g | Rare      |  12   |
|    5    | 2300g | Rare      |  13   |
|   6+    | 5000g | Legendary |  14   |

The materials required to craft potions and spell scrolls depends on their rarity:

Common & Uncommon
: 1 elemental essence plus 1 per fatigue, plus 1 metal

Rare & Legendary
: 1 fade essence plus 1 per fatigue, plus 1 metal

### Potions

Potions can be made from any spell that can target a single creature, or with spells with targeting charms that emanate from the caster (like **blast**, **emanate**, and **spray**). When quaffing a potion, you don't need to pay its upfront fatigue cost, but if you need to concentrate on it, or if there's a fatigue cost beyond activation, you do. For spells that can have varying fatigue cost when cast (like cure wounds), the potion name should include a number to distinguish how much fatigue is covered, e.g. _Potion of Cure Wounds I_ for a 1-fatigue version, _Potion of Cure Wounds II_ for a 2-fatigue version, _Potion of Cure Wounds III_ for a 3-fatigue version, etc…. Potions can be used by using Use Item, and they last for the full duration of the spell without requiring concentration.

### Spell Scrolls

Spell scrolls can be made from any spell. Whenever you read a spell from a spell scroll, it has a chance to disintegrate. If you have a spellcasting feat and the spell is part of your spell list, roll +SPELL, otherwise roll +LUCK—on a strong hit, you cast the spell, paying all costs as normal. On a weak hit, you cast the spell, paying all costs as normal, but the spell scroll disintegrates after use. On a weak hit, the spell fails; don't pay any cost (except the AP used to try and cast it) and the scroll disintegrates. Spells cast from spell scrolls can't be upcast, but can be concentrated on.

### Healing Potions

Healing potions are a special kind of magical item specifically meant as a quick form of healing outside of a rest. They come in three forms: a health potion, a greater health potion, and a potion of invigoration:

| Potion                 |      Healing      | Cost  | Rarity   | Count |
| :--------------------- | :---------------: | :---: | :------- | :---: |
| Health Potion          |      1d4 HP       |  50g  | Common   |   2   |
| Greater Health Potion  |      2d4 HP       | 100g  | Common   |   4   |
| Potion of Invigoration | 4d4 HP +2 fatigue | 1000g | Uncommon |  16   |

Healing potions can be [crafted](#crafting) for 1 wood per d4 of healing plus 1 metal.

## Upgrading Equipment

As you adventure, you'll want to upgrade your gear to be able to take on tougher and tougher foes. There are upgrades you can make to your equipment: you can improve it with mithril, you can refine it into a masterwork item, and you can enhance it with runes and seals.

### Mithril Equipment

While Mithril comes in many forms, at its core it's a material that's been seeped in magic, resulting in an incredibly strong and light material. Mithril equipment gains **1 rune slot** and its weight is reduced by 1 (reducing light weight to 0 weight and 1 weight to light weight). For armor, this also reduces the +POWER requirement to wield it by 1 (minimum 0).

While working with mithril is as easy as working with common materials, the materials themselves are much more expensive, so the purchase price of mithril equipment is 100x it's **count** (see [crafting time and cost](#time-and-cost) below). If you wanted to craft mithril equipment yourself, replace all of the material required material with mithril, but keep it's count.

### Masterwork Equipment

Masterwork equipment is the pinnacle of craftsmanship—perfectly fit and balanced, finely decorated, and of the highest quality. All masterwork equipment at their core are made of mithril, so they gain all the benefits of mithril equipment. Additionally, they all gain **1 seal slot** and, for weapons and foci, +1 piercing, for armor, +1 AC.

The attention to detail required to create masterwork equipment requires a significant time investment, and its cost shows. Masterwork equipment costs twice as much as its mithril equivalent, and if you wanted to craft it on your own, it's count would be doubled (but the material amount would remain the same). You can only attempt to make masterwork equipment yourself if you have expertise in the talent that lets you craft.

### Runes & Seals

Runes and seals are magical enhancements to weapons and armor. Runes generally modify existing properties of an item, whereas seals generally add new properties to an item. Runes and seals are not permanent—if you have a talent that lets you craft the kind of item it's attached to, you can remove them intact and replace them as a 1 count project per item. Some items you find in the wild may have runes or seals on them and aren't mithril or masterwork equipment—while you can remove the runes and seals from these items, you can't replace them once you do.

## Crafting

Who buys stuff nowadays when making your own is so easy.

### Crafting Material

As you adventure, in addition to picking up gear and weapons, you'll pick up crafting material that can either be sold or used to create new equipment. Crafting material comes in two varieties: standard crafting material and rare crafting material.

</table>

Standard crafting material is fairly common to buy and sell—most towns and cities should have a store where you can buy them. Buying material generally costs twice its value. Junk can generally be sold to general stores and taverns as well—think of it like rotten food, or silverware or plates.

Rare crafting material is harder to come by. You typically need a speciality vendor, and it typically sells for three times its value. There are three kinds of rare crafting material, Elementalis, Mithril, and Fadeite.

Elementalis
: Usually the easiest to come by—think fire sacks from a red dragon or poison glands from a purple worm. The material hums with elemental essence that can be extracted to recreate elemental effects

Mithril
: An unusually hard, light, and flexible material—think dragon bone or or wood from an ancient tree. Mithril is versatile enough that it can equally be spun into textiles or replace metal in buildings.

Fadeite
: Fadeite is the most rare of the three. It's usually a cutting or a piece of an item that's been so deeply steeped in magic that it can bend the Fade itself—think a piece of a lich's robes, the horn of a devil, or floorboard from a centuries old magical academy.

### Time and Cost

In order to craft an item, you either need to be under the instruction of an artisan of the kind of item you're trying to craft (like a blacksmith), or you yourself have a background or proficiency in crafting the kind of item (likely from a talent or a class). You also need the relevant [tools](#tools) available.

With those prerequisites met, you craft an item by taking the **work on a project** downtime activity. Each item has a countdown associated with it—the total amount of work you need to do to complete the item. An item's countdown is equal to twice the total number of crafting material required, plus the total cost divided by 50 (this is the effort and skill required to properly craft the item). Before you can start crafting an item, you need at least half of its material. Crafting an item consumes the material used in its crafting.

Multiple people can work on the same item—they all must meet the crafting prerequisites in order to do so, and share the countdown for the item.
