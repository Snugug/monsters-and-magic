## Weight and carrying capacity

While adventuring, you're going to pick up stuff, and that stuff has weight. How much weight you can lug around is your carrying capacity, and how much you're currently carrying is your load.

Each 1 weight weighs approximately 5-10 lbs. There are some items, though, that have a negligible effect on your load; they have 0 weight. Other items only have an effect on your load when you've got a bunch of them, those are marked as light weight. 10 light weight items, in any combination, weighs 1 weight. Some items, like a backpack, make it easier to carry more; their weight is negative. Any combination of 1000 gold and gems that don't have their own weight has 1 weight.

Your carrying capacity is the most you can carry before becoming encumbered and is equal to double your +POWER plus 10. When you're encumbered, you have -1 movement and take -1 ongoing to all rolls until you're no longer encumbered. Your load can never be more than your carrying capacity +3.

## Weapons

Weapons deal damage! If you have mastery with a weapon, you gain its technique for free, as long as you continue to have mastery of it. Some weapons also have properties describing how they can, or need to, be used.

Unarmed and improvised attacks deal 1 damage.

:::message[Weapons in Story Mode]

If playing in story mode, you deal half the weapon's damage die instead of rolling for damage, so a dagger that deals 1d4 damage would deal 2 damage. If a weapon deals more than 1 die of damage, you deal damage for each die, plus 1 for each die above 1. For a maul that deals 2d6 damage, for instance, you'd deal 3 + 3 + 1 damage for a total of 7 damage.

:::

Some weapons have special weapon properties—every property always applies to the weapon when wielded. All weapons also have a mastery property—if you gain weapon mastery of that weapon, you can use the mastery property.

### Weapon Properties

Agile
: Can use +CUNNING instead of +POWER for attack and damage rolls. If wielding two agile weapons and deal damage or fatigue to a creature with your primary weapon, you can spend 1-fatigue to attack it with your secondary weapon; this damage does not include your ability score.

Heavy
: Requires +POWER of 1 or greater to wield.

Piercing
: Ignore an amount of AC equal to the piercing amount when dealing weapon damage, or deal additional fatigue equal to ½ the piercing amount (minimum 1) when dealing fatigue.

Precise
: Rewards careful strikes over brute force, can use +FOCUS instead of +POWER for attack and damage rolls.

Reach
: Melee weapons only. Your reach with this weapon is 10' instead of the normal 5'.

Reload
: Takes extra effort to reload-it can only be fired once per turn

Simple
: Basic weapons anyone can use.

Thrown
: Can be thrown. If thrown, it's treated as a ranged weapon (but cannot use ammunition) and has a range of 30'.

Two-handed
: Unwieldy and must be used with two hands

Versatile
: Can wield with one hand or two; if wielding with two, add +1 damage to damage rolls when used as a melee weapon. Can swap between one handed and two handed by using Use Item

### Weapon Mastery

Nick
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 1-fatigue on a strong hit to apply sundered

Graze
: When you strike with this weapon and miss, deal damage equal to your +POWER.

Ring
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 2-fatigue on a hit to apply impaired

Cleave
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 1-fatigue to deal half the damage you dealt to your target to another creature within the weapon's reach.

Sap
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 1-fatigue on a hit to apply weakened

Pinpoint
: When you strike with this weapon, mark 1-fatigue on a hit to become prepared for your next attack roll against your target.

## Foci

Foci allow you to channel your magic, letting you cast spells as a spellcaster. In order to cast spells, you must have at least one focus equipped. Each focus has a set of properties that affect your spellcasting when equipped. In addition to the foci below, any simple melee weapon can be used as a focus and have the **assail** property—a few common weapon foci are presented below. Some foci have weapon properties like **two-handed** and **versatile**—refer to those properties for definitions.

:::message[Dual-Wielding Foci]{.info}

Because you don't need an empty hand to cast spells as long as you're wielding a focus, think about how you may dual-wield with them! You could wield a dagger and orb to get the benefits of either one depending on which you use to cast your spells. Or a wand and a shield for extra protection.

import Foci from '$components/mdx/Foci.svelte';

<Foci />

### Foci Properties

Assail
: Can be used as the normal weapon, or can Use Item and channel one of your cantrips. While channeled, the weapon takes on a magical appearance in line with the cantrip being used, you can cast spells with that cantrip at melee range, and you can substitute a base level cantrip for a weapon attack taking reactions. You can Use Item again to change your weapon back to its normal form or to another cantrip.

Extend
: When you apply a condition or status with a spell through this focus, you can mark 1-fatigue per target to extend its duration by 1 round. You can choose how many targets to extend.

Empower
: When you strike a creature with a cantrip through this focus, add your +SPELL to the damage you deal (half if you deal fatigue).

## Armor

Armor is your level of protection against incoming blows, and comes in three types: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Light armor provides the least amount of protection, but it's the easiest to wear—you add your full +CUNNING to your AC when wearing it. Medium armor provides a moderate amount of protection but is bulkier—you add half of your +CUNNING to your AC when wearing it. Heavy armor provides the most protection, but it's bulky—you don't add your +CUNNING to your AC when wearing it.

Some armor is bulky enough that you need a minimum amount of +POWER to wear it. If your +POWER is less than the required amount, you can't wear that armor. If it's equal to your +POWER, you take -2 ongoing to all rolls to attempt to be stealthy or sneaky while wearing it.

You can also equip a shield. Shields provide a bonus to your AC while wielding it. Unlike armor, shields are part of your loadout.
