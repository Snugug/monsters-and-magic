In the world of Monsters & Magic, your character is your entryway to your world. It's your in-world persona, through which you'll tell a story.

## Ending a Session

At the end of each session you may resolve one bond. To do so, talk to the player of the character you share the bond with and decide if the bond still describes how you relate. If it no longer does, maybe because circumstances have changed or there's no longer a question about their actions, resolve your bond. Any time you look at a bond and think "that's not a big factor in how we relate anymore", the bond is at a good place to resolve. When you resolve a bond, mark 1 XP. If the bond's resolution increases your connection with that character, increment your BOND with them by 1, if it decreases it, decrement it by 1.
