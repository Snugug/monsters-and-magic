title: "Character Origins"

Your character origin is made up of your lineage, heritage, and talents.

## Lineages

Your lineage is your bloodline—it represents your parents, their parents, their parents, and back through time! Maybe your parents came from the same lineages, or maybe from different ones. Maybe there's some infernal, celestial, or even draconic blood running through your veins!

When you pick your lineage, you gain 3 points to spend on the traits you inherit from your lineage. You can either choose to belong to a single lineage, in which case you spend all of your points on traits available to that lineage, or have a mixed lineage, where you pick two lineages and choose traits available to either—if you pick a mixed lineage, you must choose at least one trait from each lineage.

Once you've determined your traits, describe the physical appearance of your character. First, choose your size. Each lineage has a size, or sizes, that they grow to—if there are multiple options, choose one, if you come from a mixed lineage, choose one from either of your parents. Then, describe your other physical traits—if you're a Dracona, the maybe the prevalence and coloring of your scales, Dwarf, the size and style of your beard.

## Talents

Talents are a word or phrase that describes a specific set of skills, personality traits, experiences, or aptitudes your character has gained over the course of their life. Whenever a talent may be applicable to a ability check you're making, you can ask the GM if you can make a skill check instead of the applicable roll. Talents can't be used in place of attack roll or saving throws.

There's no set list of talents, but they can't be too broadly applicable and can't grant your character specific mechanical benefits, like spells, special abilities, or senses. Talents like "One-Hit Kill" or "Invincible" imply game-breaking special abilities, and "Supergenius" or "Omniskilled" are too broad and could be applied to virtually any roll. The best talents **SEL**—they're **specific** (relevant in key situations but not something that you'll rely on multiple times a session every session) and either **earned** (through your hard work or through your station in life but not something you're born with) or **learned** (something you could teach to others or that you've picked up through your life).

Great talents draw on your heritage and the background you've written for your character—a Noble may have a talent "Princess of the House of Dragons" whereas a Criminal may have a talent "Magic Item Fence for the Big City Thieves' Guild".

Talents start with a modifier equal to your proficiency bonus, and as you level up you can choose to increase the bonus as a level up option. You can also gain additional talents as you level up. You may gain expertise in a talent—double your talent's bonus when you roll with a talent you're an expert in.
