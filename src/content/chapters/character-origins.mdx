title: Character Origins
chapter: 3

Your character origin is made up of your lineage, heritage, and talents.

## Lineages

Your lineage is your bloodline—it represents your parents, their parents, their parents, and back through time! Maybe your parents came from the same lineages, or maybe from different ones. Maybe there's some infernal, celestial, or even draconic blood running through your veins!

When you pick your lineage, you gain 3 points to spend on the traits you inherit from your lineage. You can either choose to belong to a single lineage, in which case you spend all of your points on traits available to that lineage, or have a mixed lineage, where you pick two lineages and choose traits available to either—if you pick a mixed lineage, you must choose at least one trait from each lineage.

Once you've determined your traits, describe the physical appearance of your character. First, choose your size. Each lineage has a size, or sizes, that they grow to—if there are multiple options, choose one, if you come from a mixed lineage, choose one from either of your parents. Then, describe your other physical traits—if you're a Dracona, the maybe the prevalence and coloring of your scales, Dwarf, the size and style of your beard.
