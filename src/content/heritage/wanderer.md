Because you've spent your life wandering from place to place, never settling down, you've picked up a knack always having the right item on you. Add a **Wanderer's Pack** to your inventoryâ€”when you use Retrieve Item from the pack, you can pull out a mundane item that's useful for your current situation. Work with your GM to figure out what item you have taken out. Once you use this, you can't use it again until you've made your daily preperations.
