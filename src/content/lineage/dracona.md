You've got dragon blood running through your veins. Choose a draconic ancestry—it determines the elemental type of the traits you choose:

| Dragon |  Element  |
| :----: | :-------: |
| Black  |   Acid    |
|  Blue  | Lightning |
| Brass  |   Fire    |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper |   Acid    |
|  Gold  |   Fire    |
| Green  |  Poison   |
|  Red   |   Fire    |
| Silver |   Cold    |
| White  |   Cold    |

Your gain scales the color of the dragon you've chosen, and you gain dragon-like features of your choice, like a reptilian face, a tail, clawed hands, etc…
