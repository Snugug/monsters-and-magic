    description: When crafting, you can replace up to ½ of the required common materials junk, and you make crafting rolls with +2 ongoing. As part of your daily preparations, you can create a tiny clockwork device with 0 AC, 0 fatigue, and 1 HP, like a toy, fire starter, or music box. The trinket can perform a single task that cannot affect more than 1 cubic foot of space or last more than 1 hour, and must be harmless, such as cleaning or soiling an object, warming, chilling, or flavoring nonliving material, lighting or snuffing a fire source like a candle or torch, or displaying an illusory image.
