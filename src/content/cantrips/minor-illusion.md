Create an illusory sound or image at a point within 30', no louder than a scream and no larger than a 5-foot cube, to distract a creature, for 1 minute. The image or sound lasts for the duration and cannot be changed once cast. You can have a total number of illusions cast equal to your proficiency bonus—if you try and cast more, the first one cast disappears.

If a creature tries to discern the true nature of the illusion, they make a focus saving throw against your Save DC; on a hit, they see through the illusion, marking 1-fatigue on a weak hit. On a miss, they become impaired, and can't attempt the save again unless circumstances change that would cause them to reevaluate the true nature of the illusion.

The illusion doesn't hold up to physical inspection; physical objects will pass through images, and sounds will have no origin. If a creature sees this happen, they roll their saving throw with advantage.
