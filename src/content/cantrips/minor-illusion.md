Create an illusory sound or image at a point within 30', no louder than a scream and no larger than a 5-foot cube, to distract a creature, for 1 minute. The image or sound lasts for the duration, cannot be changed once cast, and dissipates if you cast this cantrip again unless cast with an effect charm. If a creature tries to discern the true nature of the illusion, they make a focus saving throw against your Save DC; dealing 1 fatigue on a weak hit or inflicting impaired on a miss. On a weak hit or a strong hit, the illusion dissipates.

The illusions don't hold up to physical inspection; physical objects will pass through images, and sounds will have no origin. If a creature sees this happen, they roll their saving throw with advantage.
