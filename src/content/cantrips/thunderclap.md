Direct a gust of wind at a target within 40 feet that explodes in a pop of thunder when it hits them, dealing 1d6 force damage and pushing them 10 feet in a direction of your choice. If this would push them into direct harm (like over a cliff), they can make power saving throw—on a hit, they resist being pushed, but mark 1-fatigue on a weak hit.
