Drawing on your deep connection to nature, you gain an **animal companion**. Choose one of the provided stat blocks for a land, sea, or sky companion. It acts independently of you, rolling its own initiative in combat, and obeys your commands. In combat, it will dodge unless you spend 1 AP to direct it on how to act. While you cannot speak directly with your companion, your bond is deep enough that you two can understand each other at a surface level.

Your animal companion dies if it drops to 0 HP. If it has died within the last hour, you can spend 2 AP and mark 3-fatigue to touch it and restore it to life with full hit points after 1 minute. If it has been longer than an hour, you can concentrate over it for 10 minutes and mark 1-exhaustion to immediately bring it back to life with full hit points. Otherwise, whenever you tend to wounds or clear fatigue, for every 1 supply you spend to heal yourself, heal your animal companion, too, and recover the appropriate amount of fatigue.

As part of your daily preparations, you can choose a different form for your animal companion, keeping its current HP, fatigue, and exhaustion levels. You can never have more than one companion.
