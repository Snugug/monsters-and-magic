You gain the ability to shape-shift into a beast. When you do so, all of your equipment merges into your body and you take on the statistics and traits of the beast you transform into, replacing yours,  while retaining your +FOCUS and +LUCK scores, your HP, and your fatigue and exhaustion. While transformed, you cannot speak unless someone is able to talk with animals and speaks to you, you cannot cast spells, and you're viewed as the animal you're transformed into by others. Any statuses or conditions you have when you transform are carried over, and any techniques you know that can be used with unarmed attacks can be used in your wild shape form, provided your wild shape has an anatomy that would allow it.

Wild shaping requires 1 AP. Once transformed, you can change to any other beast forms you're able to shape intoâ€”doing so requires 1 AP per transformation, but does not require a use of your wild shape. When you initially transform, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus. You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining 1 expended use on a short rest, and all expended uses as part of your daily preparations. You remain in your wild shape form until you dismiss it for 1 AP, are rendered unconscious, you die, or you finish a long rest.

You can choose from any CR0 Beast without a fly speed.
