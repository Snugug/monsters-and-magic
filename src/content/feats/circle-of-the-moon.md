Your wild shape grows stronger. The maximum challenge rating for your wild shape is now equal to your proficiency bonus, and starting when you reach Epic tier, your choice can include beasts with a fly speed. 

Additionally, when you initially transform, you gain an additional 5 temporary hit points, and  can mark 1-fatigue when you hit a creature with an unarmed or natural weapon (claws, beak, etcâ€¦) while wild shaped to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
