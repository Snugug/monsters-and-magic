Your fast hands and quick thinking make using some basic techniques quicker. The Hide and Disengage techniques only cost you 1 AP to use, if you use the Move technique more than once in a turn, the second use of it only costs 1 AP, and you can reduce the AP cost of Use Item and Retrieve Item techniques to 0 by marking 1-fatigue
