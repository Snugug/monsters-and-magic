When you gain this feat, gain an additional talent, then choose one of your talents—you gain expertise in it. Starting at Level 2, whenever you gain a talent by reaching a new tier of play, choose one of your talents and gain expertise in it, too. If you retrain a talent you're an expert in, it does not retain your expertise.

Additionally, when you gain this feat, choose two weapons with which you are proficient—gain weapon mastery for them. At the end of a long rest, you can change which weapons you have mastery of from the list of weapons you're proficient with.
