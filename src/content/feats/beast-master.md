Add your proficiency bonus to your Animal Companion's attack and damage rolls, fatigue, and HP. You and your Animal Companion also both gain the **tag team** techniqueâ€”your companion can only choose you, or another friendly creature that it knows, as their partner when using it. Finally, the benefits of your hunter's mark now extend to your animal companion.
