Whenever you fail a skill check, you can trigger a contingency plan. Spend a thread of fate to explain how your contingency plan was triggered, and then either roll a new skill check with a different talent, explaining how that one is now relevant, or have an ally make a skill check with a relevant talent that'll take the place of your skill check. If that fails, you can spend another thread of fate to do it again, and again, and again, and so on, but neither you nor your allies can roll with the same talent twice for your contingency planning.

If at any point during your contingency plans a strong hit is rolled, exclaim how you knew this plan would work, and gain +2 forward to act on your contingency plan. 

Increase your maximum number of threads of fate by 1.
