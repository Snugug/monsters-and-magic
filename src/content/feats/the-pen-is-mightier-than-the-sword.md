When telling the story of what happened here today, it's ok to embellish a little bit if it'll make it more exciting! Before combat starts, you can choose an opponent you can see and make a luck roll, DC 10 plus their challenge rating. You learn what kind of creature they are (or appear to be) and their CR. On a weak hit, they also become weakened and you learn one of their descriptors (GM's choice), on a strong hit they become weakened, you learn two of their descriptors, and can add or remove one, and on a critical hit they become permanently weakened, you learn three of their descriptors,and can add or remove two. On a miss, a duplicate of the creature appears, with ½ the original's HP. On a critical miss, another duplicate appears, with ¼ the original's HP.

You can use this a number of times per day equal to your PB.

Additionally, when attacking with precise weapons, you can use +LUCK for attack and damage rolls.
