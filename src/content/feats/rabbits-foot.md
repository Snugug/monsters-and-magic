You've learned how to bend the luck of others. You can now choose one of the following when spending a thread of fate:

- Reroll an ability check you've made with a bonus equal to +LUCK. Choose which result to use.
- As a reaction to an ability check made by a creature you can see, force them to reroll it with a bonus or penalty (your choice) equal to +LUCK. They must use the new results.
- As a reaction to an ability check made by a creature you can see, force them to add +LUCK as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the result after they've made it.
- As a reaction to an ability check made by a creature you can see, force them to make the roll with advantage or disadvantage (your choice).

Increase your maximum number of threads of fate by 1.
