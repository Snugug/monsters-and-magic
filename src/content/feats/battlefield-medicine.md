Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense. When you Disengage, you can mark up to 3-fatigue to gain +1 AC for each fatigue marked until the start of your next turn. You also gain additional ways to use your Adrenaline Surge:

Top Up
: As a reaction to a creature within your reach using **Regroup**, heal them for +POWER hit points

Patch Up
: Spend 1 AP to heal a creature within your reach two times your +POWER hit points

Cool Down
: Spend 2 AP to apply **invigorated** to a creature within your reach.

Increase your maximum number of adrenaline points by 1.
