You press your advantages wherever you can. When you use one of your adrenaline points, you can move up to half your speed without provoking reactions for moving out of reach of an enemy. Additionally, as a reaction to a creature using a technique in combat that you don't already know, you can spend 1 adrenaline point and mark 3-fatigue, or 1-exhaustion if it's rare, to learn it. Once you do this, you can't do it again until you've finished your daily preparations, and you can only learn a number of techniques this way equal to your +FOCUS (minimum 1). Finally, choose an additional fighting style, which can include one of the following:

Blind Fighting
: Gain blindsight 10'.

Alert
: If not unconscious, roll initiative with advantage
