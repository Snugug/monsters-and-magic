Whenever you deal damage to a creature with an attack roll, you can mark up to your +LUCK in fatigue to potentially do extra damage to it. For each fatigue you marked, roll 1d6.

- Set aside dice that you've rolled if:
    - You roll triples or better
    - A die face equals your +LUCK or 1
    - You roll a straight using all of your die (minimum 3 die)
    - You roll a full house  (only two numbers rolled, minimum 2 of each number) using all of your die
- If you have dice you haven't set aside, you can choose to reroll them
- If you have set aside all of your dice, you can mark the total number rolled, then reroll all of the dice. You can do this a maximum number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Hold 1-farkle.

You can choose to stop rolling at any time. When you do take the total number rolled and deal it as damage to the creature you're attacking—the damage gains +1 piercing for each **farkle** you're holding (which is then reset to 0). If at any time you roll and aren't able to set aside any die, you lose all die you've set aside and any you've banked and deal no additional damage to the creature. You must set aside at leas your +LUCK to deal any damage.
