You are able to manifest your **oath** as divine energy. Choose a number of cantrips equal to ½ your **oath** (minimum 1) from the divine spell list, and a number of charms equal to ½ your proficiency bonus, with your **oath** as your **spellcasting modifier**.. If you do not have an **oath**, you can choose 1 cantrip and 1 charm, and your **spellcasting modifier** is 1. 

After you hit a creature with a melee or ranged weapon attack, you can mark 2-fatigue to channel one of your cantrips into the attack as a **smite**. You cannot charm these cantrips, but you can upcast them; if your original attack doesn't meet the upcast AP requirements, you can either mark additional AP to meet the requirements or mark an additional 2-fatigue for each additional AP required. You can choose whether to channel one of your spells this way after you've rolled your attack but before you resolve damage.

While **oathbroken**, whenever you try to cast a spell or **smite** a foe, mark fatigue as normal, then make a focus saving throw, On a miss, it fails. On a weak hit, it works, but it's strenuous; mark an additional 1-fatigue. On a strong hit, it works as expected.
