Your connection to animals grows. You gain the ability to speak to animals. On your turn, you can spend 1 AP to transfer your consciousness into an animal within 100' of you or your animal companion no matter its distance from you, as long as it's on the same plane of existence as you. While yosaring into an animal, you can perceive through its senses and control its actions. You are stunned and unaware of your surroundings while doing this, but can end your yosaring (and the condition) at will. 

Additionally, you can communicate with your animal companion telepathically up to 100' away from you.
