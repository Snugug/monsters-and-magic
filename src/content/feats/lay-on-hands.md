You gain a pool of energy you can use to heal, or harm, equal to three times your +POWER, plus your **oath**.

While **oathbound**, you can spend 1 AP to touch a creature (including yourself) and heal them up to the remaining points in your pool, or spend 5 points to remove a condition from a creature.

While **oathbroken**, you can spend 1 AP to instead touch a creature and inflict necrotic damage on them, up to the remaining points in your pool, or spend 5 points to inflict weakened or doomed on them.
