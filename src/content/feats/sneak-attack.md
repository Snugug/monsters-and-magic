Once per turn, when you deal damage with a ranged or agile weapon attack, you can mark a number of fatigue up to your proficiency bonus—for each fatigue marked, deal an extra 1d6 damage. You can only do this if you have advantage on, or were prepared for, the attack roll, are empowered, or another foe of your target is within close range of them.

Additionally, you can choose to increase any technique's AP cost by 2 to mark yourself as prepared for the attack roll as you look for an opening in your target's defenses.
