You know how to hit an enemy where it hurts. Whenever you attack a creature with an unarmed attack or melee weapon, you can apply sundered to yourself (if you don't already have it) to increase your success by **+1 step**, and can choose to do so after you've seen the results.

Additionally, while raging, you can mark 1-fatigue and choose one of the following brutal strike options on a hit with a melee weapon or unarmed attack:

- Add your +POWER to your damage roll as an additional bonus
- Push the target 10 feet away from you and then close the gap without triggering reactions
- Apply slowed to the target.

Finally, choose a number of melee weapons you're proficient with equal to your +POWER; you gain weapon mastery with them. You can change your selection at the end of a long rest.
