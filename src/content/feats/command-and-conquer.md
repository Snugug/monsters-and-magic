You command the battlefield, directing your allies to victory. Once per short rest, you can spend 1 AP to survey all enemies you can see—you learn their CR, vulnerabilities, and resistances, if any. You also gain additional ways to use your Adrenaline Surge:

Bait & Switch
: Spend 1 AP to switch places with a willing, conscious creature within 5 feet of you. This does not provoke reactions from moving out of a creature's reach. Until the start of your next turn, either you or the creature you moved gains a bonus to their AC equal to your proficiency bonus.

Rally
: Choose an ally within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you—they become **quickened**

Menace
: Apply **frightened** to a creature you hit with a weapon attack.

Increase your maximum number of adrenaline points by 1
