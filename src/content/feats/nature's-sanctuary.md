You gain the ability to cause a spectral tree to appear, providing shade, nourishment, and protection. Spend 2 AP and one of your Wild Shape charges to make the tree appear on the ground within 120' of yourself. It fills a 15' cube, but does not block the space it's in, and lasts for 1 minute or until you are marked unconscious or die. You and your allies have partial cover while inside the the tree's area, and it grows a number of spectral apples equal to your proficiency bonusâ€”allies within the tree's area can retrieve and eat a spectral apple using the **use item** action, restoring 5 HP when they do.
