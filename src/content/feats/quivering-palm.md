You gain the ability to set up vibrations in a creature. When you score a strong hit on a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend **5-ki** to set up vibrations in their body that last a number of days equal to 10 times your proficiency bonus. The vibrations are harmless until you spend 2 AP on your turn to end them. When you do, the target must make a power saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + +FOCUS. On a miss, they take 5d12 damage, bypassing AC and any resistances they have, half as much on a weak hit.

You can only have one creature under this effect at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly in a creature for free.
