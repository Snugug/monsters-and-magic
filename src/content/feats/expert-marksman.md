You zero in on your enemy's weaknesses. While you have temporary hit points or are invisible, your weapon attacks have +2 ongoing to attack rolls and gain piercing equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, once per turn, if you strike a creature when you have advantage, you can forgo rolling with advantage and instead strike the creature twice as part of the same attack, rolling separate attack rolls for each attack.

Choose an additional fighting style.
