You can draw upon your inner fury to drive yourself in battle. Spend 1 AP to start raging and become empowered and invigorated. Spend 1 AP on subsequent turns to keep your rage going, for up to a minute. At the end of your rage, mark 1-exhaustion.

Additionally, while raging, add your +POWER to your AC as long as you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield.

Finally, gain a talent related to your strength or fury that describes where your rage builds from.
