When you are reduced to 0 HP while raging, you don't fall unconscious. Instead, you can continue acting until either you gain 1-exhaustion, you fail a death save, you're killed from taking damage, or until the end of combat, at which point you fall unconscious and mark 1 failed death save. If you stabilize while up, you heal to 1 HP.
