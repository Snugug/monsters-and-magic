You become the embodiment of Justice's blade; you can treat any weapon you're proficient with as a **weapon** **focus**. While channeling a cantrip with your **weapon focus**, your weapon attacks with that weapon gain +1 piercing. Whenever you **smite** with the same cantrip that you're channeling with your **weapon focus**, you can choose to charm it as long as the charm doesn't change the cantrip's targeting.

While **oathbound**, whenever you **smite** a creature with the same cantrip you're channeling with your **weapon focus**, reduce the amount of fatigue you need to mark to upcast your **smite** by 1.

While **oathbroken**, whenever you **smite** a creature with the same cantrip you're channeling with your **weapon focus**, you can mark 1-fatigue to reduce the AP you need upcast your **smite** by 1 (minimum 1)
