Your martial arts training has honed your reflexes to the pinnacle of what's possible. When you are hit with an attack that deals damage to you, you can take a reaction to reduce the damage by your +CUNNING + Proficiency Bonus. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can redirect the attack to a creature within 5 feet of you if the attack was a melee attack or 60 feet of you if it was a ranged attack, provided the target isn't behind full cover. They take damage equal to your +CUNNING + proficiency bonus, of the same type as the attack.

Additionally, when you Move, you can move along vertical surfaces and liquids as long as you do not end your movement on them, and your first use of flurry of blows on your turn doesn't exhaust your reaction.
