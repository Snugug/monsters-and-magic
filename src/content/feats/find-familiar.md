You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form of your choice in the form of a CR0 tiny creature. It acts independently of you, but obeys your commands.

You can telepathically communicate with your familiar from up to 100 feet away and can spend 1 AP on your turn to see and hear through them, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.

During combat, it rolls its own initiative and can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal. On your turn, you can cast one of your cantrips through your familiar; if you do so, its AP and fatigue cost is increased by one, and its range changes to touch.

If your familiar drops to 0 HP, it disappears. You can spend an hour resummoning it, which can be done in conjunction with finishing a short rest or as part of your daily preparations. You can also temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension on your turn for 1 AP. When it disappears, it leaves behind anything it was wearing or carrying.
