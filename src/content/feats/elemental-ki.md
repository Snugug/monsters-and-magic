You learn how to manipulate and channel the elements through your ki. Choose one of the following cantrips:

- Fire Bolt
- Water Whip
- Stone Sling
- Lighting Lasso
- Thunderclap

+POWER is your spellcasting ability. You gain the Control Element charm, plus a number of non-rare charms equal to your +POWER. They, and your cantrip, are always prepared. You gain proficiency with weapon foci, can use a shortsword or longsword you have equipped as a weapon focus, and while using Ki Transformation and have at least one hand free, you are treated as having a dangerous focus. While transformed, your hair and your ki aura take on colors and non-harmful effects based on the cantrip you've chosen, and you can choose to have your unarmed attacks deal the same damage type as your cantrip. Your flurry of blows also can now be triggered by hitting a creature with your cantrip.
