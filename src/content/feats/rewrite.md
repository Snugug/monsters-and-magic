On your turn, you can spend a thread of fate to direct allies to act instead of you. They spend your AP on your turn to take their action, but you must mark any fatigue they use. They can use any technique you know, and if they can cast spells, they can use any cantrips you know. You, of course, can take credit for what they've done in the retelling. 

Increase your maximum number of threads of fate by 1.
