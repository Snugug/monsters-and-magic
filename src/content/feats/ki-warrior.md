You gain proficiency, and mastery, of a ki blast, an energy beam that fires like an arrow and that counts as a simple ranged weapon that deals 1d6 damage, has a range of 120', and the pinpoint mastery property. You can use this ki blast for any attack made with a weapon. You use your +POWER for attack and damage rolls with this weapon. You also gain two new techniques: ki charge and ki transformation.
