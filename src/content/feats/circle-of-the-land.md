As part of your daily preparations, choose one type of terrain: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. You gain resistance to an elemental type based on the terrain you've chosen and, if you can cast spells, you gain a cantrip:

| Terrain | Cantrip | Element |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arid | Fire Bolt | Fire |
| Polar | Water Whip | Cold |
| Temperate | Lightning Lasso | Lightning |
| Tropical | Poison Spray | Poison |

While wild shaped, you can mark 1-fatigue when you hit a creature with an unarmed or natural weapon (claws, beak, etcâ€¦) to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the elemental type associated with your terrain, and hints of your chosen terrain harmlessly manifest on your body (like sparks occasionally flickering between porcupine spikes or the ends of fur lightly smoldering).

Finally, whenever you take the **gather supplies** downtime activity while within your chosen terrain, you can increase your check by +1 step.
