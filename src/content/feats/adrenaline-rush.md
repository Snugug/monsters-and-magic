In the heat of battle, you can push yourself further than other combatants. You gain a number of adrenaline points you can use to power extraordinary feats in combat equal to your proficiency bonus. You can spend your adrenaline points to do one of the following:

Bulk Up
: Regain a number of hit points equal to 2x your +POWER when you **Regroup**

Pump Up
: Give yourself temporary hit points equal to your +POWER

Second Wind
: Reduce the AP required to **Regroup** by 1

You regain one adrenaline point when you finish a short rest, and you regain all of them as part of your daily preparations. You can only use one adrenaline point per turn.
