When you enter your rage, you become an avatar of a primal force. When selecting this feat, choose one of the following:

The Spreading Fire
: Your weapon attacks deal fire damage, and you gain resistance to fire damage. When you use your **brutal strike** you can mark 2-fatigue instead of 1 to apply **doomed** to your target. When you take the **move action** can mark 2-fatigue to jump to a distance within your speed, dealing fire damage equal to your **+POWER** to all creatures next to you when you both leave and land.

The Unrelenting Wave

Your speed is increased by 10 feet, and any creature that attacks you while you move, or whose space you run through while you move, must succeed on a DC 10 +POWER **power saving throw** or be pushed back 10 feet, 5 feet on a **weak hit**.

The Oncoming Storm

When you take the **move action** you can mark 2-fatigue to teleport up to your SPEED, which does not provoke reactions for moving.

Divine Retribution
: Your weapon attacks deal radiant damage, and you gain resistance to radiant damage. When you use your brutal strike you can mark 2-fatigue instead of 1 to apply sundered. When you enter your rage or when you sustain it, you can mark 2-fatigue to sprout wings until the start of your next turn, granting you a fly speed equal to your SPEED.

Damned Fury
