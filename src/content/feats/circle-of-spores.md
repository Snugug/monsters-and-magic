You gain a symbiotic link with fungi, letting you tap into the cycle of life and death. If you can cast spells, you gain the **toll the dead** cantrip and the **leech** charm. You also gain a halo of invisible spores that surround you in a 10' aura that grant you blindsight within it, and can mark 1-fatigue when you hit with a weapon attack to a creature within the aura to deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage.
