Choose a valid combination of any cantrip plus any charms you know, that is now your signature spell; give it a name and describe it! Gain a number of signature spells equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

Your signature spells do not count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you do not need their base cantrip or charms prepared to use them.

You can cast your signature spells at -1 AP and -1 fatigue (minimum 1 each) a total number of times per day between them equal to your Proficiency Bonus and can cast them normally as often as you would like.
