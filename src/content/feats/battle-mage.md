When using a weapon focus, you can enter a **battle mage stance** as part of the action to activate it. As part of entering this stance and preparing yourself for battle, you become invigorated and can cast either a shield or armor charmed spell on yourself (marking fatigue as normal). Additionally, spells using the cantrip you channel can add your +SPELL to their damage or healing rolls when cast at melee range. Your stance ends early if you're disarmed or you otherwise stop having your weapon focus available, otherwise it lasts for 1 minute. You can use this a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus.

While your battle mage stance is active, you can choose to transform your familiar one size category larger than you, enabling you to ride it as a controlled mount When it does so, it gains +10 temporary HP but is otherwise unchanged.
