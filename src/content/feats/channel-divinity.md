You gain the ability to channel your deity’s might through you. You can **channel divinity** a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain one use at the end of a short or long rest, and regain all uses as part of your daily preparations. If one of your channel divinity options requires a creature to make a save, the DC is 10 plus +FOCUS. Your Holy Symbol is a focus that represents your deity.

Divine Light
: Spend 2 AP and present your Holy Symbol to a creature you can see within 30’ of you. They heal 2d6 HP.

Divine Wrath
: Spend 2 AP and present your Holy Symbol to a creature you can see within 30’ of you. They make a **power saving throw**; on a **miss** they take 2d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), half as much on a **weak hit**.

Turn Undead
: Spend 2 AP, mark 2-fatigue, and present your Holy Symbol to censure Undead creatures of your choice within 30’ of you. They must make a **focus saving throw**, on a **miss**, they become **frightened** until they take damage or until you become **stunned** or **unconscious**. On a **weak hit**, **frightened** will also end at the end of their next turn. While **frightened** this way, they are also **stunned**. 

Guidance
: As a reaction to a creature making a **skill check**, but before they roll, you can bless them with words of guidance, letting them add 1d4 to their roll. If they roll a **miss**, this use of **channel divinity** isn't expended.
