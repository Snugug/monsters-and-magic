You spend 10 minutes to create a number of unseen servants equal to your +FOCUS. Unseen servants are invisible, mindless, shapeless, medium sized forces that perform simple tasks at your command for one hour. They have 0 AC, 1 HP, 0 fatigue, 0 exhaustion, 0 in all abilities, and can't attack. If it drops to 0 HP, it vanishes from existence.

As a bonus action while they're within long range of you, you can mentally command a servant to perform a simple task that a human could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes it, then waits for your next command. Servants can't move more than a short range each round.

If you are ever a long range away from your unseen servant, the spell ends early. When you create your servants, you can designate a single structure or grounds (like a tavern or the grounds of a homestead) as a safe space for your servants; when they're created there, or you bring them there, they can stay there, carrying out tasks, while you leave. You can have a total number of servants bound to a structure or grounds equal 3x your +FOCUS. You can only have one structure or grounds designated as safe at a time, and you can never have more than 3x your +FOCUS number of servants at a time.
