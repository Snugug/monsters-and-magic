- Once per turn, you can mark 3-fatigue to turn a strong hit against a creature you have marked with Hunter's Mark into a critical hit.
- When you mark a creature with Hunter's Mark, you learn its CR and any vulnerabilities it may have
- When you hit a Hunter's Mark marked creature, you can spend 2-fatigue to either apply sundered or weakened 
- While in your **favored terrain** your mark takes a penalty to attack rolls made against you, and you gain a bonus to attack rolls made against them, equal to your +FOCUS

You can change your **favored terrain** to the area you're currently in by spending an extended rest dedicated entirely to scouting your surroundings.
