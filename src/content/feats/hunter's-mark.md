Set your sights on a target. You can spend 1 AP and mark 1-fatigue on your turn to mark a creature you can see as your quarry for 1 minute. Once per turn while marked, you deal an additional 1d6 damage to it when you hit it with a weapon attack and gain +2 ongoing when trying to sense it. If your quarry drops to 0 hit points before the duration ends, you can immediately spend 1-fatigue to mark a new creature as your query. When initially marking a creature, you can mark 3-fatigue instead of 1 to extend the duration to 10 minutes, or 5-fatigue to extend it to 1 day. 

While you’re a capable hunter no matter where you find yourself, where you’ve honed your skills is where you feel the most at home. Choose two of the following areas as your **favored terrain**:

- Urban areas
- Rural civilized areas
- Ocean
- Tundra
- Taiga
- Wetland
- Temperate Rainforest
- Temperate Deciduous Forest
- Tropical Rainforest
- Tropical Seasonal Forest
- Grassland
- Savanna
- Hot Desert
- Mountains

Gain a talent with expertise for each of your **favored terrain** based on your time and knowledge in them. Whenever you spend a significant amount of time in one of these areas, you can replace one of these talents with one for the new area, representing your shifting expertise. When you're in your **favored terrain**, reduce the fatigue cost of marking a creature by 1.
