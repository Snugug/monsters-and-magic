You're a magical academic, studying the mechanical minutia of spellcasting, breaking down arcane magic into its constituent parts and building it back up again. Your **spellcasting ability** is +FOCUS.

When you gain this feat, you gain a spellbook if you don't already have one. Your spellbook is your repository of knowledge of all things spellcasting. Choose a total number of non-rare charms and cantrips equal to twice your FOCUS (with a minimum of 1 cantrip). When choosing your cantrips, pick from ones  with the "arcane" tag.

As part of your daily preparations, you can prepare a total number of cantrips and charms from your spellbook equal to your +FOCUS + your Proficiency Bonus.

You can add spells to your spellbook, either by copying them from a spell scroll or learning them from another wizard. Doing so requires special ink, with cantrips costing 200g, charms costing 100g + 100g per fatigue, and spells that comprise of both costing their total cantrip + charm cost, plus 100g. If your spellbook is destroyed, you can recreate it by crafting a new one for the cost of 100g. Be creative with your spellbook! It doesn't need to be a dusty old tome; it may be tattooed onto you, or stitched into your robes.

Finally, when you take this feat, gain a talent related to the arcane or academia, and gain expertise in that talent.
