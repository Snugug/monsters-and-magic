Choose a deity; you are a vessel for their will on the material plane, granting you the ability to cast spells as a manifestation of their will. Your **spellcasting ability** is +FOCUS.

When you gain this feat, you gain the **healing word** cantrip and a number of additional cantrips equal to your Proficiency Bonus from the **divine** spell list. Whenever your Proficiency Bonus increases, gain another cantrip.

As part of your daily preparations, you can prepare a number of charms equal to your +FOCUS from the list of non-rare charms that can be used for the cantrips you know. If you learn a rare charm as an option when you level up, you can include that in the list of charms to choose from.

When you take this feat, gain a talent related to your faith, and gain expertise in that talent.
