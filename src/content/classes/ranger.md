  - title: Hunter's Mark
    core: true
    spellcasting: false
    rare: false
    description: |-
      Set your sights on a target. You can spend 1 AP and mark 1-fatigue on your turn to mark a creature you can see as your quarry for 1 minute. Once per turn while marked, you deal an additional 1d6 damage to it when you hit it with a weapon attack and gain +2 ongoing when trying to sense it. If your quarry drops to 0 hit points before the duration ends, you can immediately spend 1-fatigue to mark a new creature as your query. When initially marking a creature, you can mark 3-fatigue instead of 1 to extend the duration to 10 minutes, or 5-fatigue to extend it to 1 day. 

      While you’re a capable hunter no matter where you find yourself, where you’ve honed your skills is where you feel the most at home. Choose two of the following areas as your **favored terrain**:

      - Urban areas
      - Rural civilized areas
      - Ocean
      - Tundra
      - Taiga
      - Wetland
      - Temperate Rainforest
      - Temperate Deciduous Forest
      - Tropical Rainforest
      - Tropical Seasonal Forest
      - Grassland
      - Savanna
      - Hot Desert
      - Mountains

      Gain a talent with expertise for each of your **favored terrain** based on your time and knowledge in them. Whenever you spend a significant amount of time in one of these areas, you can replace one of these talents with one for the new area, representing your shifting expertise. When you're in your **favored terrain**, reduce the fatigue cost of marking a creature by 1.
  - title: Animal Companion
    core: true
    spellcasting: false
    rare: false
    description: |-
      Drawing on your deep connection to nature, you gain an **animal companion**. Choose one of the provided stat blocks for a land, sea, or sky companion. It acts independently of you, rolling its own initiative in combat, and obeys your commands. In combat, it will dodge unless you spend 1 AP to direct it on how to act. While you cannot speak directly with your companion, your bond is deep enough that you two can understand each other at a surface level.

      Your animal companion dies if it drops to 0 HP. If it has died within the last hour, you can spend 2 AP and mark 3-fatigue to touch it and restore it to life with full hit points after 1 minute. If it has been longer than an hour, you can concentrate over it for 10 minutes and mark 1-exhaustion to immediately bring it back to life with full hit points. Otherwise, whenever you tend to wounds or clear fatigue, for every 1 supply you spend to heal yourself, heal your animal companion, too, and recover the appropriate amount of fatigue.

      As part of your daily preparations, you can choose a different form for your animal companion, keeping its current HP, fatigue, and exhaustion levels. You can never have more than one companion.

      Your connection to animals grows. You gain the ability to speak to animals. On your turn, you can spend 1 AP to transfer your consciousness into an animal within 100' of you or your animal companion no matter its distance from you, as long as it's on the same plane of existence as you. While yosaring into an animal, you can perceive through its senses and control its actions. You are stunned and unaware of your surroundings while doing this, but can end your yosaring (and the condition) at will. 

      Additionally, you can communicate with your animal companion telepathically up to 100' away from you.

      - While in your **favored terrain** your mark takes a penalty to attack rolls made against you, and you gain a bonus to attack rolls made against them, equal to your +FOCUS

      You can change your **favored terrain** to the area you're currently in by spending an extended rest dedicated entirely to scouting your surroundings.
