  - title: Arcane Scholar
    core: true
    spellcasting: true
    rare: false
    description: |-
      You're a magical academic, studying the mechanical minutia of spellcasting, breaking down arcane magic into its constituent parts and building it back up again. Your **spellcasting ability** is +FOCUS.

      When you gain this feat, you gain a spellbook if you don't already have one. Your spellbook is your repository of knowledge of all things spellcasting. Choose a total number of non-rare charms and cantrips equal to twice your FOCUS (with a minimum of 1 cantrip). When choosing your cantrips, pick from ones  with the "arcane" tag.

      As part of your daily preparations, you can prepare a total number of cantrips and charms from your spellbook equal to your +FOCUS + your Proficiency Bonus.

      You can add spells to your spellbook, either by copying them from a spell scroll or learning them from another wizard. Doing so requires special ink, with cantrips costing 200g, charms costing 100g + 100g per fatigue, and spells that comprise of both costing their total cantrip + charm cost, plus 100g. If your spellbook is destroyed, you can recreate it by crafting a new one for the cost of 100g. Be creative with your spellbook! It doesn't need to be a dusty old tome; it may be tattooed onto you, or stitched into your robes.

      Finally, when you take this feat, gain a talent related to the arcane or academia, and gain expertise in that talent.
  - title: Find Familiar
    core: true
    spellcasting: false
    rare: false
    description: |-
      You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form of your choice in the form of a CR0 tiny creature. It acts independently of you, but obeys your commands.

      You can telepathically communicate with your familiar from up to 100 feet away and can spend 1 AP on your turn to see and hear through them, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.

      During combat, it rolls its own initiative and can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal. On your turn, you can cast one of your cantrips through your familiar; if you do so, its AP and fatigue cost is increased by one, and its range changes to touch.

      If your familiar drops to 0 HP, it disappears. You can spend an hour resummoning it, which can be done in conjunction with finishing a short rest or as part of your daily preparations. You can also temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension on your turn for 1 AP. When it disappears, it leaves behind anything it was wearing or carrying.
  - title: Unseen Servant
    core: false
    spellcasting: false
    rare: false
    description: |-
      You spend 10 minutes to create a number of unseen servants equal to your +FOCUS. Unseen servants are invisible, mindless, shapeless, medium sized forces that perform simple tasks at your command for one hour. They have 0 AC, 1 HP, 0 fatigue, 0 exhaustion, 0 in all abilities, and can't attack. If it drops to 0 HP, it vanishes from existence.

      As a bonus action while they're within long range of you, you can mentally command a servant to perform a simple task that a human could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes it, then waits for your next command. Servants can't move more than a short range each round.

      If you are ever a long range away from your unseen servant, the spell ends early. When you create your servants, you can designate a single structure or grounds (like a tavern or the grounds of a homestead) as a safe space for your servants; when they're created there, or you bring them there, they can stay there, carrying out tasks, while you leave. You can have a total number of servants bound to a structure or grounds equal 3x your +FOCUS. You can only have one structure or grounds designated as safe at a time, and you can never have more than 3x your +FOCUS number of servants at a time.

    rare: true
    description: |-
      Choose a valid combination of any cantrip plus any charms you know, that is now your signature spell; give it a name and describe it! Gain a number of signature spells equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

      Your signature spells do not count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you do not need their base cantrip or charms prepared to use them.

      You can cast your signature spells at -1 AP and -1 fatigue (minimum 1 each) a total number of times per day between them equal to your Proficiency Bonus and can cast them normally as often as you would like.
  - title: Battle Mage
    core: false
    spellcasting: false
    rare: true
    description: |-
      When using a weapon focus, you can enter a **battle mage stance** as part of the action to activate it. As part of entering this stance and preparing yourself for battle, you become invigorated and can cast either a shield or armor charmed spell on yourself (marking fatigue as normal). Additionally, spells using the cantrip you channel can add your +SPELL to their damage or healing rolls when cast at melee range. Your stance ends early if you're disarmed or you otherwise stop having your weapon focus available, otherwise it lasts for 1 minute. You can use this a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus.

      While your battle mage stance is active, you can choose to transform your familiar one size category larger than you, enabling you to ride it as a controlled mount When it does so, it gains +10 temporary HP but is otherwise unchanged.
