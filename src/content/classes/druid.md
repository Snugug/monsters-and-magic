  - title: Druidic Circle
    core: true
    spellcasting: true
    rare: false
    description: |-
      Your deep connection with nature has drawn you to a druidic circle where you have learned how to tap into the energy of living things to cast spells. Your **spellcasting ability** is +FOCUS.

      When you gain this feat, choose a number of cantrips from the **primal** spell list equal to your proficiency bonus +1. Whenever your proficiency bonus increases, gain another cantrip.

      As part of your **daily preparations**, you can prepare a number of charms equal to your **+FOCUS** from the list of non-rare charms that can be used for the cantrips you know. If you learn a rare charm as an option when you level up, you can include that in the list of charms to choose from.

      Gain a talent with expertise related to nature.
  - title: Wild Shape
    core: true
    spellcasting: false
    rare: false
    description: |-
      You gain the ability to shape-shift into a beast. When you do so, all of your equipment merges into your body and you take on the statistics and traits of the beast you transform into, replacing yours,  while retaining your +FOCUS and +LUCK scores, your HP, and your fatigue and exhaustion. While transformed, you cannot speak unless someone is able to talk with animals and speaks to you, you cannot cast spells, and you're viewed as the animal you're transformed into by others. Any statuses or conditions you have when you transform are carried over, and any techniques you know that can be used with unarmed attacks can be used in your wild shape form, provided your wild shape has an anatomy that would allow it.

      Wild shaping requires 1 AP. Once transformed, you can change to any other beast forms you're able to shape into—doing so requires 1 AP per transformation, but does not require a use of your wild shape. When you initially transform, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus. You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining 1 expended use on a short rest, and all expended uses as part of your daily preparations. You remain in your wild shape form until you dismiss it for 1 AP, are rendered unconscious, you die, or you finish a long rest.

      You can choose from any CR0 Beast without a fly speed.

    rare: false
    description: |-
      As part of your daily preparations, choose one type of terrain: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. You gain resistance to an elemental type based on the terrain you've chosen and, if you can cast spells, you gain a cantrip:

      | Terrain | Cantrip | Element |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | Arid | Fire Bolt | Fire |
      | Polar | Water Whip | Cold |
      | Temperate | Lightning Lasso | Lightning |
      | Tropical | Poison Spray | Poison |

      While wild shaped, you can mark 1-fatigue when you hit a creature with an unarmed or natural weapon (claws, beak, etc…) to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the elemental type associated with your terrain, and hints of your chosen terrain harmlessly manifest on your body (like sparks occasionally flickering between porcupine spikes or the ends of fur lightly smoldering).

      Finally, whenever you take the **gather supplies** downtime activity while within your chosen terrain, you can increase your check by +1 step.

      Your wild shape grows stronger. The maximum challenge rating for your wild shape is now equal to your proficiency bonus, and starting when you reach Epic tier, your choice can include beasts with a fly speed. 

      Additionally, when you initially transform, you gain an additional 5 temporary hit points, and  can mark 1-fatigue when you hit a creature with an unarmed or natural weapon (claws, beak, etc…) while wild shaped to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
  - title: Nature's Sanctuary
    core: false
    spellcasting: false
    rare: false
    description: You gain the ability to cause a spectral tree to appear, providing shade, nourishment, and protection. Spend 2 AP and one of your Wild Shape charges to make the tree appear on the ground within 120' of yourself. It fills a 15' cube, but does not block the space it's in, and lasts for 1 minute or until you are marked unconscious or die. You and your allies have partial cover while inside the the tree's area, and it grows a number of spectral apples equal to your proficiency bonus—allies within the tree's area can retrieve and eat a spectral apple using the **use item** action, restoring 5 HP when they do.
  - title: Circle of Spores
    core: false
    spellcasting: false
    rare: true
    description: You gain a symbiotic link with fungi, letting you tap into the cycle of life and death. If you can cast spells, you gain the **toll the dead** cantrip and the **leech** charm. You also gain a halo of invisible spores that surround you in a 10' aura that grant you blindsight within it, and can mark 1-fatigue when you hit with a weapon attack to a creature within the aura to deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage.
  - title: Archdruid
    core: false
    spellcasting: false
    rare: true
    description: You can speak and cast spells while transformed using Wild Shape form as long as they do not have a material component that has a cost and is consumed. When transformed using Wild Shape, your unarmed attacks and natural weapons (like your claws, beak, tail, etc…) count as a **weapon focus**.
