      You gain proficiency, and mastery, of a ki blast, an energy beam that fires like an arrow and that counts as a simple ranged weapon that deals 1d6 damage, has a range of 120', and the pinpoint mastery property. You can use this ki blast for any attack made with a weapon. You use your +POWER for attack and damage rolls with this weapon. You also gain two new techniques: ki charge and ki transformation.

      Your martial arts training has honed your reflexes to the pinnacle of what's possible. When you are hit with an attack that deals damage to you, you can take a reaction to reduce the damage by your +CUNNING + Proficiency Bonus. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can redirect the attack to a creature within 5 feet of you if the attack was a melee attack or 60 feet of you if it was a ranged attack, provided the target isn't behind full cover. They take damage equal to your +CUNNING + proficiency bonus, of the same type as the attack.

      Additionally, when you Move, you can move along vertical surfaces and liquids as long as you do not end your movement on them, and your first use of flurry of blows on your turn doesn't exhaust your reaction.

      Whenever you use  Flurry of Blows, on a strong hit, you can add one effect to an attack. Each attack can only have one effect applied, and some effects require you to spend stored ki to use:

      Push
      : Push the target 15 feet

      Slow
      : Apply **slowed** to the target

      Addle
      : Spend 1-ki to prevent the target from taking reactions until the start of its next turn

      Topple
      : Spend 1-ki to knock the target **prone**

      Drain
      : Spend 1-ki to deal 2 fatigue instead of your normal damage and apply **doomed** to the target

      Stun
      : Spend 3-ki to apply **stunned** to the target

      Choose one of the following cantrips:

      - Fire Bolt
      - Water Whip
      - Stone Sling
      - Lighting Lassoo
      - Thunderclap

      +POWER is your spellcasting ability. Gain a number of non-rare charms equal to your +POWER. They, and your cantrip, are always prepared. You gain proficiency with weapon foci, can use a shortsword or longsword you have equipped as a weapon focus, and while using Ki Transformation and have at least one hand free, you are treated as having a dangerous focus. While transformed, your hair and your ki aura take on colors and non-harmful effects based on the cantrip you've chosen, and you can choose to have your unarmed attacks deal the same damage type as your cantrip. Your flurry of blows also can now be triggered by hitting a creature with your cantrip.

      You now hold 1-ki per AP spent on Ki Charge. Ki Transformation makes you quickened and increases your unarmed strikes and ki blasts damage die size by 1. While transformed, you gain a fly speed equal to your SPEED.

      Additionally, when you use ki charge you can mark fatigue 1:1 to hold 1-ki more or to heal yourself 5 HP.

    description: |-
      You gain the ability to set up vibrations in a creature. When you score a strong hit on a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend **5-ki** to set up vibrations in their body that last a number of days equal to 10 times your proficiency bonus. The vibrations are harmless until you spend 2 AP on your turn to end them. When you do, the target must make a power saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + +FOCUS. On a miss, they take 5d12 damage, bypassing AC and any resistances they have, half as much on a weak hit.

      You can only have one creature under this effect at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly in a creature for free.
