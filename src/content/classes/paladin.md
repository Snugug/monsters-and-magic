  - title: Oathbound
    core: true
    spellcasting: false
    rare: false
    description: |-
      You have sworn an **oath**, an overall driving motivator for yourself, something like "I will protect the innocent from those who would do them harm" or "I will bring the crown to heel for what it's done to me". Your **oath** includes a **vow** related to how you will accomplish that in the form of a +BOND with yourself. Your **oath** starts at 0 and can never be more than your proficiency bonus. When you resolve a **vow**, gain experience as normal, and if it's resolved positively, increase your oath.

      If you break your **oath**, either by acting against it or by failing a **vow** (it resolves either negatively or neutrally), you become **oathbroken** and are no longer **oathbound**. In order to become oathbound again, you must take a day of extended downtime to focus solely on recentering yourself and spend 100g on a tithing for each point of your **oath**, after which you can either restore your **oath** at -1, or you can swear a new **oath** starting at 0 and write new **vows**.

      Your conviction to your oath radiates out from you within a 10' aura. While **oathbound**, add your **oath** as a modifier to your ability checks, and creatures of your choice within your aura can add your **oath** to their skill checks as a modifier. While **oathbroken**, when a creature enters your aura, it must make a focus saving throw, on a miss they become frightened of you for 24 hours. On a weak hit, they become frightened of you until they are no longer within your aura. At the end of each of their turns, they can repeat this save as long as they are not within your aura; on a strong hit they become immune to this effect until they finish a long rest.
  - title: Smite
    core: true
    spellcasting: true
    rare: false
    description: |-
      You are able to manifest your **oath** as divine energy. Choose a number of cantrips equal to ½ your **oath** (minimum 1) from the divine spell list, and a number of charms equal to ½ your proficiency bonus, with your **oath** as your **spellcasting modifier**.. If you do not have an **oath**, you can choose 1 cantrip and 1 charm, and your **spellcasting modifier** is 1. 

      After you hit a creature with a melee or ranged weapon attack, you can mark 2-fatigue to channel one of your cantrips into the attack as a **smite**. You cannot charm these cantrips, but you can upcast them; if your original attack doesn't meet the upcast AP requirements, you can either mark additional AP to meet the requirements or mark an additional 2-fatigue for each additional AP required. You can choose whether to channel one of your spells this way after you've rolled your attack but before you resolve damage.

      While **oathbroken**, whenever you try to cast a spell or **smite** a foe, mark fatigue as normal, then make a focus saving throw, On a miss, it fails. On a weak hit, it works, but it's strenuous; mark an additional 1-fatigue. On a strong hit, it works as expected.
  - title: Faithful Steed
    core: false
    spellcasting: false
    rare: false
    description: |-
      You gain the service of an otherworldly **faithful steed.** The steed is loyal to you and can act as a controlled mount for you. In combat, it acts on your turn. While **oathbound**, choose a manifestation for your steed: celestial, fiend, or fey. While **oathbroken**, your steed reverts to a normal beast 

      Your **faithful steed** dies if it drops to 0 HP. If it has died within the last hour, you can spend 2 AP and mark 3-fatigue to touch it and restore it to life with full hit points after 1 minute. If it has been longer than an hour, you can concentrate over it for 10 minutes and mark 1-exhaustion to immediately bring it back to life with full hit points. Otherwise, whenever you tend to wounds or clear fatigue, for every 1 supply you spend to heal yourself, heal your **faithful steed**, too, and recover the appropriate amount of fatigue.

      As part of your daily preparations, you can change the manifestation of your steed.

      **Faithful Steed**

      - 20 HP | 2 Fatigue | 1 Exhaustion | 2 AC | Medium
      - -1 Focus | 2 Power | 1 Cunning

  - title: Lay On Hands
    core: false
    spellcasting: false
    rare: false
    description: |-
      You gain a pool of energy you can use to heal, or harm, equal to three times your +POWER, plus your **oath**.

      While **oathbound**, you can spend 1 AP to touch a creature (including yourself) and heal them up to the remaining points in your pool, or spend 5 points to remove a condition from a creature.

      While **oathbroken**, you can spend 1 AP to instead touch a creature and inflict necrotic damage on them, up to the remaining points in your pool, or spend 5 points to inflict weakened or doomed on them.
  - title: Sword of Justice
    core: false
    spellcasting: false
    rare: true
    description: |-
      You become the embodiment of Justice's blade; you can treat any weapon you're proficient with as a **weapon** **focus**. While channeling a cantrip with your **weapon focus**, your weapon attacks with that weapon gain +1 piercing. Whenever you **smite** with the same cantrip that you're channeling with your **weapon focus**, you can choose to charm it as long as the charm doesn't change the cantrip's targeting.

      While **oathbound**, whenever you **smite** a creature with the same cantrip you're channeling with your **weapon focus**, reduce the amount of fatigue you need to mark to upcast your **smite** by 1.

      While **oathbroken**, whenever you **smite** a creature with the same cantrip you're channeling with your **weapon focus**, you can mark 1-fatigue to reduce the AP you need upcast your **smite** by 1 (minimum 1)
