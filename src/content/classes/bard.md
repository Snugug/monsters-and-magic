      When telling the story of what happened here today, it's ok to embellish a little bit if it'll make it more exciting! Before combat starts, you can choose an opponent you can see and make a luck roll, DC 10 plus their challenge rating. You learn what kind of creature they are (or appear to be) and their CR. On a weak hit, they also become weakened and you learn one of their descriptors (GM's choice), on a strong hit they become weakened, you learn two of their descriptors, and can add or remove one, and on a critical hit they become permanently weakened, you learn three of their descriptors,and can add or remove two. On a miss, a duplicate of the creature appears, with ½ the original's HP. On a critical miss, another duplicate appears, with ¼ the original's HP.

      You can use this a number of times per day equal to your PB.

      Additionally, when attacking with precise weapons, you can use +LUCK for attack and damage rolls.

    description: You know a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Gain a talent, then choose one of your talents to gain expertise in. Gain either mastery of a weapon you're proficient in, which you can swap as part of your daily preparations, the ability to cast a cantrip of your choice, or a non-rare technique of your choice. Finally, increase your maximum number of threads of fate by 1.

      Whenever you take a long rest, you and a number of creatures of your choice up to your +LUCK regain +1 thread if they tend to wounds or clear fatigue. As part of your daily preparations, you regain a number of threads of fate equal to your +LUCK.

      On your turn, you can spend a thread of fate to direct allies to act instead of you. They spend your AP on your turn to take their action, but you must mark any fatigue they use. They can use any technique you know, and if they can cast spells, they can use any cantrips you know. You, of course, can take credit for what they've done in the retelling. 

      Increase your maximum number of threads of fate by 1.
  - title: I Make Plans.
    core: false
    spellcasting: false

      Whenever you fail a skill check, you can trigger a contingency plan. Spend a thread of fate to explain how your contingency plan was triggered, and then either roll a new skill check with a different talent, explaining how that one is now relevant, or have an ally make a skill check with a relevant talent that'll take the place of your skill check. If that fails, you can spend another thread of fate to do it again, and again, and again, and so on, but neither you nor your allies can roll with the same talent twice for your contingency planning.

      If at any point during your contingency plans a strong hit is rolled, exclaim how you knew this plan would work, and gain +2 forward to act on your contingency plan.

      You've learned how to bend the luck of others. You can now choose one of the following when spending a thread of fate:

      - Reroll an ability check you've made with a bonus equal to +LUCK. Choose which result to use.
      - As a reaction to an ability check made by a creature you can see, force them to reroll it with a bonus or penalty (your choice) equal to +LUCK. They must use the new results.
      - As a reaction to an ability check made by a creature you can see, force them to add +LUCK as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the result after they've made it.
      - As a reaction to an ability check made by a creature you can see, force them to make the roll with advantage or disadvantage (your choice).

      Increase your maximum number of threads of fate by 1.
  - title: Farkle
    core: false
    spellcasting: false
    rare: true
    description: |-
      Whenever you deal damage to a creature with an attack roll, you can mark up to your +LUCK in fatigue to potentially do extra damage to it. For each fatigue you marked, roll 1d6.

      - Set aside dice that you've rolled if:
          - You roll triples or better
          - A die face equals your +LUCK or 1
          - You roll a straight using all of your die (minimum 3 die)
          - You roll a full house  (only two numbers rolled, minimum 2 of each number) using all of your die
      - If you have dice you haven't set aside, you can choose to reroll them
      - If you have set aside all of your dice, you can mark the total number rolled, then reroll all of the dice. You can do this a maximum number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Hold 1-farkle.

      You can choose to stop rolling at any time. When you do take the total number rolled and deal it as damage to the creature you're attacking—the damage gains +1 piercing for each **farkle** you're holding (which is then reset to 0). If at any time you roll and aren't able to set aside any die, you lose all die you've set aside and any you've banked and deal no additional damage to the creature. You must set aside at leas your +LUCK to deal any damage.
