title: Hold
---

A temporary resource connected to the source you got it from that you "hold onto" until you spend it as outlined. For example, if a move tells you to “hold 3-shield”, you gain 3 points to spend on that move’s options and effects. The source of your hold will tell you how to spend it, like “one-for-one”, meaning you can spend one point of hold on one of the move’s possible effects. Since you’re “holding” onto it, you don’t need to spend all of your hold at once! You might spend hold right away on an effect or save it for later in a scene.
