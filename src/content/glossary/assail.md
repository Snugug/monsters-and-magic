Can be used as the normal weapon, or can Use Item and channel one of your cantrips. While channeled, the weapon takes on a magical appearance in line with the cantrip being used, you can cast spells with that cantrip at melee range, and you can substitute a base level cantrip for a weapon attack taking reactions. You can Use Item again to change your weapon back to its normal form or to another cantrip.
