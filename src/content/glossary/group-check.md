type: []
---

Each creature that's part of a group rolls the appropriate ability check, then:

1. Treat a critical miss as two misses and a critical success as two strong hits
2. For each strong hit, remove once miss
3. Add up each result, whichever has the highest total is how the group's done
4. If there's a tie, use the lowest of the tied results.
