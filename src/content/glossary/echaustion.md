title: Echaustion
type: []
---

**Exhaustion** describes how much a creature has exerted itself. Each PC has 5 **exhaustion**. Creatures take an ongoing penalty for each **exhaustion level**:

| Exhaustion | Penalty    |
| :--------- | :--------- |
| 1          | -          |
| 2          | -1 ongoing |
| 3          | -1 ongoing |
| 4          | -2 ongoing |
| 5          | -3 ongoing |

These penalties are not cumulative with each other, but they do stack on top of other modifiers to rolls you have, and they cannot be negated. If a creature needs to make an exhaustion and they have no more left to mark, they're knocked unconsious.
