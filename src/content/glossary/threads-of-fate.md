title: Threads of Fate
type: []
---

A resource used to to bend the narrative, influence rolls, or maybe even get out of trouble. PCs have a number of **threads** equal to their proficiency bonus. When you spend a **thread**, choose one:

- **Feeling Lucky** - Make a luck roll and use it instead of an ability check you’ve made, you’ve forced a creature to make, or a creature has made against you (like an attack roll).
- **Bend Luck** - Add +LUCK as a bonus to an ability check you’ve made, or as a penalty to an ability check you’ve forced a creature to make or a creature has made against you (like an attack roll), after it’s been made but before it’s been resolved (like rolling for damage). Negative +LUCK will reduce an ability check you’ve made and increase one made by another creature.
- **Lucky Find** - Add something helpful to the current narrative that you would have been lucky to stumble across, like the key to a locked door or a cipher for an ancient script. The GM may ask you to spend multiple **threads** depending on your suggestion, or may veto your suggestion (in which case you don’t spend your thread)
- **Bonds of Fate** - Lean into your shared history with another character, letting them add their +BOND with you to their roll, or your +BOND with them to your roll.
