You gain a breath weapon you can use, just like your draconic ancestors. Your breath weapon deals 1d6 damage of the element type of your chosen draconic ancestor, and you must mark 2-fatigue and usr 2 AP to use it. When you use it, you can either use it as a blast 30 foot long, 5 foot wide line from you, or a spray, a 15 foot cone from you. Creatures in your blast or spray must make a saving throw based on the damage type, DC 10 + +POWER; on a miss, they take full damage and are inflicted with a condition based on the damage type, on a weak hit they take half damage and are not inflicted with a condition.

| Element | Saving Throw | Condition |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Fire | Cunning | Doomed |
| Cold | Power | Slowed |
| Lightning | Cunning | Weakened |
| Poison | Power | Weakened |
| Acid | Power | Sundered |

You can increase the power of your breath weapon by spending additional AP and fatigue:

| AP | Fatigue | Damage | Blast | Spray |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| +1 | +1 | +1 die | +5' Long | +5' Cone |
| +1 | +2 | +2 die | +10' Long | +10' Cone |
| +2 | +3 | +3 die | +15' Long | +15' Cone |
| +2 | +4 | +4 die | +20' Long | +20' Cone |

You can only spend a additional amount of fatigue equal to your proficiency bonus.
