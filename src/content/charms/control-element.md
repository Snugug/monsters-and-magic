Control an element associated with your cantrip. The amount you control must fit within a contiguous 5'x5'x5' cube, and you cannot directly affect or damage other creatures with the element you are controlling. The effect lasts as long as you are concentrating on the spell, although narratively appropriate changes can outlast your concentration. For every level you upcast, you can increase the dimensions of the cube by 5' per side. If you upcast to at least 2nd level, you can optionally cause a creature or creatures in the affected area to make a saving throw, on a miss you may apply doomed, restrained, slowed, or prone, depending on the narrative of what you have done.
