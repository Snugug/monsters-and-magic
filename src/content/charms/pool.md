Create an area on the ground that is 10'x10' centered on a point within range. The area becomes difficult terrain, applying slowed to all creatures in it. The first time a creature moves in the area on its turn, it must succeed on a saving throw. For every level you upcast, increase the dimensions of the area by 5' per side. The area dissipates when you're no longer concentrating on it.
