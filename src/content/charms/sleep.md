If you force a creature to mark fatigue with this spell, the target must make a +SPELL saving throw, with a bonus to your save DC equal to the fatigue you dealt. On a weak hit, they become unconscious until the end of their next turn, on a miss they become unconscious until you stop concentrating on the spell. If they take damage while unconscious, the condition immediately ends.
