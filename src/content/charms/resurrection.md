You spend an hour tending to a body that's been deceased no longer than a day. At the end of the hour, the body is resurrected with its full consciousness at 1 HP and 5 exhaustion. It does not restore any missing body parts, so if they are missing body parts critical for living, this spell will fail. The resurrection ritual requires a diamond worth 500 gold for each hour the ritual takes, which is consumed as part of the ritual.

For each level you upcast this spell, the amount of time you must spend doubles, as does the HP they return with, and their exhaustion level decreases by 1. At level 1, the body can be deceased for up to a week, at level 3 the body can be deceased for up to a year and missing limbs not critical for living can be restored, and at level 5 any body, regardless of length of it being deceased and missing limbs, can be fully restored and resurrected.
