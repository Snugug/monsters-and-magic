Cover a creature within range (including yourself) in an ablative coating; gain +SPELL temporary hit points. When a creature in close range of the target damages it and that damage reduces the amount of temporary hit points it has, deal an equal amount of the cantrip's  damage type to the creature. Add +2 temporary hit points for each level upcast.
