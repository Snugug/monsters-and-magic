If the target creature is medium or smaller, it must make a saving throw, on a weak hit, they become stunned, on a miss you take control of their body while you concentrate on this spell. While you have control of its body, you control how it spends its AP on its turn; to do so, you must use your reaction at the start of its turn and must pay the fatigue cost for any actions taken on its turn instead of it marking fatigue. If you do not exercise control over a creature on its turn, it becomes impaired for that turn.

If you would have it do something intentionally harmful to itself, and at the end of each of its turn, it may make the saving throw again, on a weak hit you lose control of its body and it becomes impaired. For each level you upcast this spell, you can target a creature one size category larger.
