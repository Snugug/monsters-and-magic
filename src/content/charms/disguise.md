The target creature, including their clothing, armor, weapons, and other items worn or carried, look different until the spell ends. You can see up to a foot taller or shorter, or appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have, otherwise, the extent of the change is up to you. The changes, though, don't hold up to physical inspection; if you give yourself a hat, for example, objects will pass through it and anyone who tries to touch it would have their hand pass through it.
