Your spell emanates out from you in a 5 foot aura. Creatures of your choice that enter the aura or end its turn within the aura must make a +SPELL saving throw or be affected by the spellâ€”creatures can choose to fail this saving throw. A creature can only be affected by this spell once per turn. This lasts as long as you are concentrating on it. Increase the size of the aura by 5 feet for each level this spell has been upcast.
