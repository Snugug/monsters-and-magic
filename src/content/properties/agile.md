type: Weapon Property

Rewards quick strikes over brute force—can use +CUNNING instead of +POWER for attack and damage rolls.

If wielding two agile weapons and you deal damage or fatigue to a creature with your primary weapon, you can spend 1-fatigue to attack the same creature with your secondary weapon. This damage does not include your ability score.
